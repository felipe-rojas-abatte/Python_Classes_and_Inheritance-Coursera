    "## 20.1.1. Object-oriented programming\n",
    "Python is an object-oriented programming language. That means it provides features that support object-oriented programming (OOP).\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-oriented programming has its roots in the 1960s, but it wasn’t until the mid 1980s that it became the main programming paradigm used in the creation of new software. It was developed as a way to handle the rapidly increasing size and complexity of software systems and to make it easier to modify these large and complex systems over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Up to now, some of the programs we have been writing use a procedural programming paradigm. In procedural programming the focus is on writing functions or procedures which operate on data. In object-oriented programming the focus is on the creation of objects which contain both data and functionality together. Usually, each object definition corresponds to some object or concept in the real world and the functions that operate on that object correspond to the ways real-world objects interact."

    "## 20.2. Objects Revisited\n",
    "In Python, every value is actually an object. Whether it be a dictionary, a list, or even an integer, they are all objects. Programs manipulate those objects either by performing computation with them or by asking them to perform methods. To be more specific, we say that an object has a state and a collection of methods that it can perform. (More about methods below.) The state of an object represents those things that the object knows about itself. The state is stored in instance variables. For example, as we have seen with turtle objects, each turtle has a state consisting of the turtle’s position, its color, its heading and so on. Each turtle also has the ability to go forward, backward, or turn right or left. Individual turtles are different in that even though they are all turtles, they differ in the specific values of the individual state attributes (maybe they are in a different location or have a different heading)."

    "## 20.3. User Defined Classes\n",
    "We’ve already seen classes like str, int, float and list. These were defined by Python and made available for us to use. However, in many cases when we are solving problems we need to create data objects that are related to the problem we are trying to solve. We need to create our own classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, consider the concept of a mathematical point. In two dimensions, a point is two numbers (coordinates) that are treated collectively as a single object. Points are often written in parentheses with a comma separating the coordinates. For example, (0, 0) represents the origin, and (x, y) represents the point x units to the right and y units up from the origin. This (x,y) is the state of the point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thinking about our diagram above, we could draw a point object as shown here.\n",
    "\n",
    "A point has an x and a y\n",
    "Some of the typical operations that one associates with points might be to ask the point for its x coordinate, getX, or to ask for its y coordinate, getY. You would want these types of functions available to prevent accidental changes to these instance variables since doing so would allow you to view the values without accessing them directly. You may also wish to calculate the distance of a point from the origin, or the distance of a point from another point, or find the midpoint between two points, or answer the question as to whether a point falls within a given rectangle or circle. We’ll shortly see how we can organize these together with the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "A point also has methods\n",
    "Now that we understand what a point object might look like, we can define a new class. We’ll want our points to each have an x and a y attribute, so our first class definition looks like this."

We can add methods to the Point class that are sensible operations for points. Had we chosen to use a tuple to represent the point, we would not have this capability. Creating a class like Point brings an exceptional amount of “organizational power” to our programs, and to our thinking. We can group together the sensible operations, and the kinds of data they apply to, and each instance of the class can have its own state.\n",

For example, with a list bound to variable L, L.append(7) calls the function append, with the list itself as the first parameter and 7 as the second parameter. Methods are accessed using dot notation. This is why L.append(7) has 2 parameters even though you may think it only has one: the list stored in the variable L is the first parameter value and 7 is the second.\n",

One thing to notice is that even though the getX method does not need any other parameter information to do its work, there is still one formal parameter, self. As we stated earlier, all methods defined in a class that operate on objects of that class will have self as their first parameter. Again, this serves as a reference to the object itself which in turn gives access to the state data inside the object."

    "You can now imagine some reasons you may want to define a class. You have seen examples of creating types that are more complicated or specific than the ones built in to Python (like lists or strings). Turtle, with all the instance variables and methods you learned about using earlier in the semester, is a class that programmers defined which is now included in the Python language. In this chapter, we defined Point with some functionality that can make it easier to write programs that involve x,y coordinate Point instances. And shortly, you’ll see how you can define classes to represent objects in a game.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **What will one instance of your class represent?** In other words, which sort of new thing in your program should have fancy functionality? One song? One hashtag? One tweet? One point? The answer to this question should help you decide what to call the class you define.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **What information should each instance have as instance variables?** This is related to what an instance represents. See if you can make it into a sentence. “Each instance represents one < song > and each < song > has an < artist > and a < title > as instance variables.” Or, “Each instance represents a < Tweet > and each < Tweet > has a < user (who posted it) > and < a message content string > as instance variables.”\n",
    "\n",
    "- **What instance methods should each instance have?** What should each instance be able to do? To continue using the same examples: Maybe each song has a method that uses a lyrics API to get a long string of its lyrics. Maybe each song has a method that returns a string of its artist’s name. Or for a tweet, maybe each tweet has a method that returns the length of the tweet’s message. (Go wild!)\n",
    "\n",
    "What should the printed version of an instance look like? (This question will help you determine how to write the __str__ method.) Maybe, “Each song printed out will show the song title and the artist’s name.” or “Each Tweet printed out will show the username of the person who posted it and the message content of the tweet.”\n",
    "\n",

The class instances are specific: e.g. the Point with a specific x and y >. You might have a Point with an x value of 3 and a y value of 2, so for that particular instance of the class Point, you’d pass in 3 and 2 to the constructor, the __init__ method, like so: new_point = Point(3,2), as you saw in the last sections.\n"
